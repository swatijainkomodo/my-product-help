# Get Started

The Medical Information Cloud documentation undergoes a major revision with each new release of Medical Information Cloud, typically made available on or around the same time a new release is eligible for installation into sandbox environments.

Between releases, the documentation is maintained and updated over time to ensure accurate and timely information. For this reason, Mavens recommends leveraging the online version, rather than static, printed versions of the documentation. For these same reasons, versions of the documentation are not published. The online version of the documentation represents the latest publicly available version of Medical Information Cloud.
