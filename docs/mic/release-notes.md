Releases
Mavens releases two major versions of Medical Information Cloud each year, which are generally available in Spring and Fall. When the major version becomes generally available, you can install it in your sandbox and production environments.

Release documentation timeline
Mavens provides release notes and updated product documentation for each release of Medical Information Cloud. All notable changes made to the V16 release notes page are captured on the Changelog page.

In addition, when a Salesforce release becomes available, Mavens performs regression testing on the supported versions of the Medical Information Cloud product to ensure core Medical Information Cloud features function as expected. Once testing is complete, Mavens publishes the test results.
