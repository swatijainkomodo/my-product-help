Known issues
To track the status of the active Medical Information Cloud known issues, reference Active KIs.

A known issue (KI) is a defect in a production environment that Mavens is aware of and has identified to be potentially impactful to multiple customers. Fixes to known issues typically ship in either subsequent product releases or hotfix releases depending on the determined impact of the defect. You can track the statuses of known issues on this page or reference the product release notes for the list of defects addressed in a release.

KI identification
The process for identifying a known issue is usually as follows:

A customer contacts support about an issue in a production environment.

The support team determines how severe the issue is and how many production customers the issue affects. If the issue impacts major user flows and multiple production customers, then the support team informs the product team.

The product team investigates the issue and determines if the defect is a bug in the product.

If the product team confirms that the defect is a bug that has a severe impact on multiple customers in production, then the product team will identify the defect as a known issue.
